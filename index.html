    <h2>The problem </h2>
    <p>
      The problem with Africa’s healthcare is an issue that is so under-talked about and can’t be addressed enough. Africa’s lack of basic healthcare has resulted in many deaths that could have been prevented and unhealthy people who can be treated.
    </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h2> Why is healthcare in Africa the way it is? </h2>
    <p> Healthcare in Africa is the way it is because of weak national institutions in many African countries which result in leaving governments open to corruption which then leads to the healthcare systems in Africa suffering from neglect and underfunding which then becomes the reason why there are not enough well-performing doctors, healthcare facilities, medicine, and many more things.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h2> Misconceptions </h2>
    <p> A common misconception about healthcare and Africa is that there is no type of modern technology in Africa which is very much incorrect, there is currently a total of 643 innovation hubs across the continent and there has been a massive growth of technology hubs in Africa, growing over 50% in the last several years so that is a very false assumption. Another misconception is that free healthcare is impossible to have without bankrupting health centers and this is also false because free healthcare just means that the service provided is not paid for by the patients at the point of the service, but rather by a third party whose resources come from various sources. For this system to work all that is necessary is private funding through fees. Services like this have been provided before and in fact, did not make health centers go bankrupt.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h2> Possible solutions </h2>
    <p> There is no one simple solution for the bad healthcare in Africa but there are many short-term and long-term solutions that could help towards the issue. Some short-term solutions could be to use mobile clinics to go to patients and to partner with or co-host pop-up clinics. Some long-term solutions could be to have countries spend more of their GDP on healthcare and to improve their doctor-to-patient ratio.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h2> Key takeaways </h2>
    <p> Some key takeaways that I would like you to take from this are to first stay informed on topics like these because simply staying informed and sharing with family and friends can really make a difference. The last key takeaway I would like you to take away is to spread awareness because the more people talk about it the more it will be addressed.</p>
