      Hello! My name is Samantha Soto I'm a 15 year old rising sophmore from Chicago. I decided to base my Activist Toolkit Project on healthcare in Africa because I believe that everyone is entitled to have the opportunity to be healthy and live their life to the fullest without having to worry about things that are completely out of their control, which in this case will be healthcare and by simply staying informed and sharing what you know with friends, family, and peers you too can help make a change in making healthcare in Africa better. Thank you.
